AM62x Sitara™ Processors from Texas Instruments are Human-machine-interaction SoC with Arm® Cortex®-
A53-based edge AI and full-HD dual display. AM6254 which is on your BeaglePlay board has a multi core design
with Quad 64-bit Arm® Cortex®-A53 microprocessor subsystem at up to 1.4 GHz, Single-core Arm® Cortex®-
M4F MCU at up to 400MHz, and Dedicated Device/Power Manager. Talking about the multimedia capabilities of
the processor you can connect upto two display monitors with 1920x1080 @ 60fps each, additionally there is
a OLDI/LVDS (4 lanes - 2x) and 24-bit RGB parallel interface for connecting external display panels. One 4 Lane
CSI camera interface is also available which has support for 1,2,3 or 4 data lane mode up to 2.5Gbps speed.
The list of features is very long and if you are interested to know more about the AM62x SoC you may take a
look at AM62x Sitara™ Processors datasheet.
